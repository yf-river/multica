// MUL-6643: the server-side rollout gate on creating a custom status is gone,
// but the key stays unpublished on purpose. v0.4.30 shipped the feature without
// the four fixes that landed in v0.4.31 — custom-status cards render in the
// wrong board column (MUL-6409), the timeline glyph loses the status identity
// (MUL-6413), built-in colors are wrong (MUL-6440), and the catalog does not
// sync over the realtime channel (MUL-6458). Those clients gate their "New
// status" button on this key and fail closed on absence, so NOT publishing it
// is what keeps a client that cannot render the result from producing one.
//
// Clients from v0.4.33 read no flag at all, so they get the button the moment
// they update — the key never has to be published again.
