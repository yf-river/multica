/**
 * Names the browser tab after whatever the workspace route has open, e.g.
 * `MUL-123: Fix login | Multica` (MUL-6222). Without it every open dashboard
 * tab renders the root metadata title, so several issues side by side are
 * indistinguishable until you click into each one.
 *
 * The URL → title resolution is not ours: it is the same pure subject parser
 * plus cache-backed presentation hook that names workspace documents, so a
 * browser tab and a deep-linked document for one URL always read identically,
 * in the user's
 * locale, and a renamed project or a changed issue title re-titles the tab
 * live. Every query behind it is cache-only, so this costs no extra request.
 *
 * Mounted once per dashboard layout — one writer for the whole tree. A page
 * that wants a different title should teach `resolveTabPresentation` about its
 * subject rather than setting `document.title` behind this component's back.
