 * Mirrored from `packages/core/issues/status-category.ts` and
 * `packages/core/issue-statuses/queries.ts` rather than imported: those modules
 * reach `../issue-statuses/index`, which pulls web's API client and React Query
 * key factories into the graph — not on mobile's import whitelist
 * (apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md). The TYPES are shared, so the two sides cannot drift
 * on shape; the fallback rules below are restated verbatim so they cannot drift
