/**
 * Names an issue's status when the surface around it only shows the CATEGORY
 * (MUL-6243).
 *
 * List sections are categories, so two issues sitting in the same "审查中"
 * section can be on different statuses — "Code Review" and "QA" — with nothing
 * on the row to tell them apart. This chip is that missing signal, mirroring
 * web's `packages/views/issues/components/custom-status-chip.tsx`.
 *
 * It renders NOTHING for a status that already is its category's built-in: the
 * section header says "审查中" and a chip repeating it is pure noise. So a
 * workspace that never defined a custom status sees no visual change at all.
 *
 * Divergence from web: the catalog arrives as a PROP rather than from a hook
 * inside. Every mobile caller is a virtualized list row that already resolved
 * the catalog for its status icon's colour, and subscribing twice per row is
 * free on the network (React Query dedupes) but not on re-renders.
